	about: If depth is 4 or 8 bits, an empty palette is allocated for the surface.
	If depth is greater than 8 bits, the pixel format is set using the [RGBA]mask parameters.
	The [RGBA]mask parameters are the bitmasks used to extract that color from a pixel. For instance,
	Rmask being FF000000 means the red data is stored in the most significant byte. Using zeros for the RGB masks sets a default value,
	based on the depth. (e.g. #CreateRGB(0,w,h,32,0,0,0,0);) However, using zero for the Amask results in an Amask of 0.
	By default surfaces with an alpha mask are set up for blending as with #SetBlendMode(#SDL_BLENDMODE_BLEND)
	You can change this by calling #SetBlendMode() and selecting a different blendMode.
