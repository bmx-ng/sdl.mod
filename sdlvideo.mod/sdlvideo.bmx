	about: Set the gamma translation table for the red, green, and blue channels of the video hardware. Each table is an
	array of 256 16-bit quantities, representing a mapping between the input and output for that channel. The input is
	the index into the array, and the output is the 16-bit gamma value at that index, scaled to the output color precision.

	returns: The OpenGL context associated with window or Null on error.
	about: Windows users new to OpenGL should note that, for historical reasons, GL functions added after OpenGL version 1.1 are
	not available by default. Those functions must be loaded at run-time, either with an OpenGL extension-handling

	about: This method operates on the current GL context; you must have created a context and it must be current before calling this method.
	Do not assume that all contexts you create will have the same set of extensions available, or that recreating an existing context
	will offer the same extensions again.
	While it's probably not a massive overhead, this method is not an O(1) operation. Check the extensions you care about after creating

	Rem
	bbdoc: Sets the swap interval for the current OpenGL context.
	returns: 0 on success or -1 if setting the swap interval is not supported.
	about: Some systems allow specifying -1 for the interval, to enable late swap tearing. Late swap tearing works the same as vsync,
	but if you've already missed the vertical retrace for a given frame, it swaps buffers immediately, which might be less jarring for
	the user during occasional framerate drops. If application requests late swap tearing and the system does not support it, this 
	method will fail and return -1. In such a case, you should probably retry the call with 1 for the interval.
	Late swap tearing is implemented for some glX drivers with GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear and for some Windows drivers with WGL_EXT_swap_control_tear.
